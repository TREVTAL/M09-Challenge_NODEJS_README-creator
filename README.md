## Description 
This project started in my coding bootcamp as a need to help me follow certain steps in order to easily create READMEs. I was doing repetitive steps to do them each homework challenge, so I decided to put my recently acquired knowledge into action. I wanted something to help me follow consistent formats and not forget any sections of the file.

## Usage
Jorge's README Creator has the following usage instructions:

* 1 Open the terminal and go to the application’s folder
* 2 open index.js using NODE.JS
* 3 Respond with the required information, Project Name and Description
* 4 for the following four steps, please use the following syntax “Step Number    Step description.  " Start your steps with a number, followed by a description, and then use a semicolon ( ; ) as a separator. This step is paramount in order for the generator to recognize different steps and include them in the final file
